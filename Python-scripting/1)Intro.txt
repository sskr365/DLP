Download python3.x installer file for windows

Python installation in Linux
If there is python2 installed, download python3 in other location instaed of deleting python2
1)Download  python 3.x using wget command by copying download link in any specific folder
2)extract using tar -xvzf
after extracting we need some compilers & dependencies to install python3 , follow below steps:

Step1: Check for wget if not then install using yum install wget 
Step2: Download requried package using wget 
       wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7...
Step3: Extract the downloaded package using tar -xvzf Python-3.7.0.tgz
Step4: yum install gcc openssl-devel bzip2-devel libffi-devel
Step4: Navigate to extracted file and then follow below steps
 cd Python-3.7.0.tgz
      ./configure 
( to install python in specific loation, .configure --prefix=/usr/bin)default location is /usrlocal/bin
  (./configure --enable-optimizations 
   ./configure --prefix=/opt
   The default installation location is: /usr/local/bin)
      make
      make altinstall (Generally we have to use make install but already if you have python then use altinstall)
Step5: Now verify installation by running
        python3 --version
 pip3 --version
