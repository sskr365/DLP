H/w understands only binaries
Types of os --> 1) single user multi-tasking 2)multi-user multi tasking (ex: many users can be created in linux)
#users --> this command shows all logged in users
In linux everything is file, configuration data is stored in text for easy movement and roll back , ability to chain program together to perform complex task (exm: cat /etc/passwd | grep ramu, which hlps in craeting scripts))

Linux Architecture:
------------------
hardware --> kernel(device interface, multi-tasking, device interface), shell(csh, sh, ksh), utilities(top, ls, cat, cd..)
#dmidecode (shows all info about h/w & resources)
#cat /proc/cpuinfo,meminfo
kernel manages resources, schedule tasks(crontab),control security(selinux)
#df -h ( detail info on file system)
shell --> on top this only executing commands, means interpreting user commands and gives result
#echo $SHELL (gives cureent shell) 
# cd /bin --> here all commands scripts are present exm: pwd, ls, cat all are in binary format
#uname -r (shows kernel version)
