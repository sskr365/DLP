DOcker basics:
-----------

kubernetes.io is officaial page for k8s

Docker Architecture:
CKA -> CKS is best for ceretification
The main uprpose of dockerization or virtualization is to main same  configurations across all environments

VM --> hypervisor is s/w which helps to create vms on top h/w rssources and vms are isolated
COntainer --> It is s/w package which contains all dependencies to run application, build once and run anywhere

Docker is a conatiner based platform where we can build, run, deploy and maintain all conatiners, docker is open source and separates application from infrastructure it means it is having own infra and easy to maintain and deploy
