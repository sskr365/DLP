1)docker search centos -> it will search all centos images of docker form dockerhub
2)docker pull ubuntu -> it will pull images(images are in layers)
3)docker images -> shows all present images
4)doker run -> create container out of image
5)docker image ls --> to check images
6)docker image rm ubuntu  --> to remove image
7)doker history <image_id> --> shows history image
8)docker tag centos centos123:v1  --> to tag docker images , we can chage version and name of image

Docker engine contains --> docker daemon(server), rest api, cli(client)
all docker commands it will communiocate to docker daemon through rest-api to commmunicate to other services

Containers are almost similar to linux becayse it uses namespaces(isolating s/m components like cpu, processes,users, files..) and cgroups(limiting resource allocation like cpu, ram)

different types of containetr(containerd component in docker) run time in market -> 1)docker, 2)lxc, 3)runc, 4)crio, 5)containerd, redhat has podman which is containerized platform
All containerized follow standarized system OCI(open conatiners initiative)
docker alternative is podman which is enchancement of docker by redhat

Docker images can be created in 2 ways 
1)commit --> can be installed packages and save
2)dockerfile ---> instructions how image should be, each instruction is layer


Instructions of docker file:
===========================
FROM -> dockerfile starts with FROM: base image
LABEL -> key value pair
MAINTAINER -> owner of file
RUN -> to execute commands
EXPOSE -> ports
ENV -> environmnet variables, but in k8s we use config-maps
ADD -> to copy files from outside like urls , tar files
COPY -> to copy locally
USER -> 
CMD -> standard commands or argumnets to entrypoint
ENTRYPOINT -> standard command to run image

To carte docker image out of docker file:
1)docker build . ( if we use standared name dockerfile, recommended and use separate folder for each project)
2)docker build . -f my_dockerfile(other than standard name)
