1)docker search centos -> it will search all centos images of docker form dockerhub
2)docker pull ubuntu -> it will pull images(images are in layers)
3)docker images -> shows all present images
4)doker run -> create container out of image

Docker engine contains --> docker daemon(server), rest api, cli(client)
all docker commands it will communiocate to docker daemon through rest-api to commmunicate to other services

Containers are almost similar to linux becayse it uses namespaces(isolating s/m components like cpu, processes, files..) and cgroups(limiting resource allocation like cpu, ram)

different types of containetr run time in market -> 1)docker, 2)lxc, 3)runc, 4)crio, 5)containerd, redhat has podman which is containerized platform
All containerized follow standarized system OCI(open conatiners initiative)
