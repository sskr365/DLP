6)face to face conversation for conveying information correctly
7)Working s/w is the primary mesaure of progress(failure rate)
8)Agile process promote sustainable development(monitoring & alerting)
9)Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enchances agility(code review -> testing)
10)simplicity -- the art of maximing the amount of work not done (use of cloud & existing services)
11)The best architecture, requirements
12)At regular intervals, the team reflects how to more effective(corecting mistakes happend on last sprint and take care in next sprint)

Scrum principles:
==================
1) empirical process control - improving with experience
2) self- organization (decision on expertise)
3) collaboration
4) value-based prioritization
5) time-boxing
6) Iterative development

Uses:
------
1)faster feedback and adjustement
2)enchanced quality(complex projects breaks down to manageable chunks)
3)Improved collaboration and ownership
4)Better productivity
5)customer satisfaction
6)transparency & communication(standups....)
7)risk mitigation(regualr standups & small chunks)
8)Increased value


Scrum Phases:
==============
1)Initiation - defining project goals, assembling the team, and setting up rnvironmnet for the project development
2)Planning - the teams creates a product backlog, which is a list of tasks done in project and plan for the first sprint(ex - to lanuch servers we use terraform)
3)Implementation - the team works on the tasks in the sprint backlog, every day there is daily scrum meeting to discuss progress and issues.
4)Review - At the end of each sprint, team holds sprint review to present the completed work to the stakeholderds
5)Retrospective - final phase of each sprint, where the team reflects on what went well and what could be improved in next sprint.


Scrum Roles & organizations:
===========================
1) product ownership
2) scrum master
3) Development Team

Scrum events:
=============
1) sprint (2 weeks)
2) sprint Planning
3) daily scrum (stand-up)
4)sprint review
5)sprint retrospective

Scrum Artifacts:
==================
1)product backlog
2)sprint backlog -  subset of product backlog
3)product increment - the sum of all product backlogs in sprint

Scrum values:
==============
1)commitment
2)courage
3)focus
4)openess
5)respect

Daily Tasks:
===========
1)procut backlog - features, functions, requirements, enchancements &fixes 
2)sprint planning -  dicusiion on product backlog, no of sprints required
3)sprint backlog - list out topics in sprint to be completed
4)daily scrum
5)works on task - tasks discussed in sprint backlog using CICD
6)Sprint Review - Sprint review meeting at the end of sprint
7)Sprint retrospective - after sprint review, team holds retrospective to reflect on their performance
8)Product Increment - 



Kanban boards:
============
kanban is lean method to manage and improve work across human systems. Its visualize work
Kanban is continuos improvement no tasks, roles , sprints where as in scrum we have all those . Kanaban is visulazation
